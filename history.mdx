## Origins

Percolator is an open-source, sharded perpetual futures DEX protocol designed for Solana. It was created and open-sourced by Solana co-founder **Anatoly Yakovenko** ([@toly](https://x.com/toly)) in October 2025 as an experimental, high-performance perps engine.

The protocol leverages Solana's speed and scalability through a unique "slab" system — a sharded matching engine that processes trades in parallel across independent units maintained by liquidity providers. This minimizes contagion risks found in traditional DEXs and enables atomic trade execution in a single transaction.

## Timeline

### October 2025 — Launch

Yakovenko uploaded the initial GitHub repositories, including the risk engine, CLI, and matcher program. He described Percolator as "implementation-ready" but explicitly for educational and research purposes — unaudited and experimental.

The architecture consists of:
- A **Router program** for collateral management
- **Slab programs** for matching and settlement
- A **CLI** for trading, keeper operations, and market management

Yakovenko positioned it as a challenge to developers to "fork and compete," sparking community interest and memecoin activity around tokens built on the protocol.

### February 2026 — SOV & Self-Sovereign Markets

On Solana devnet, Percolator evolved with community forks and active testing. Yakovenko proposed using it for **SOV** (self-sovereign / store-of-value) setups where tokens back their own inverted perpetual markets.

The SOV model:
- The memecoin IS the collateral in its own perpetual market
- Admin keys are burned for immutability
- Trading fees accrue in an insurance fund as a **soft burn** mechanism
- Supply is effectively locked over time through accumulated fees

<blockquote>
**@toly** — February 7, 2026

"sov = percolator inverted market for the memecoin, so it's backed by the memecoin + burn the admin key. The insurance fund will grow indefinitely from fees and will effectively be a soft burn."

This tweet sparked discussions on self-backed memecoin perpetuals — where the coin serves as collateral in its own market, potentially reducing supply via locked fees. Yakovenko tied this to his proposal for Darwinian memecoin selection: weak projects die out, strong ones gain organic price mechanisms without external controls.

## Toly's Dev Philosophy

Yakovenko's engagement with Percolator has been characteristically direct and meme-driven, blending technical insights with provocative encouragement to fork and experiment:

<blockquote>
"Fork the code and point your 🦞 at it."

— Using Solana's lobster meme to motivate developers
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Store of value is a meme, store of meme has value."

— On memecoin economics and the SOV model
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"What could possibly go wrong?"

— Classic Toly sarcasm on self-backing risks
</blockquote>

On using AI for audits, Yakovenko advised forkers to use LLMs for specs and verification, ending with **"Don't trust, verify."** — the ethos purple.trade follows with its [byte-for-byte source verification](/verification).

## From Fork to Platform

purple.trade maintains all four protocol repositories and builds the trading frontend on top of the Percolator engine. Original development stemmed from Yakovenko's repositories ([aeyakovenko/percolator-prog](https://github.com/aeyakovenko/percolator-prog), [aeyakovenko/percolator-cli](https://github.com/aeyakovenko/percolator-cli)).

See the [Repositories](/repo-percolator-prog) section for full documentation on each component.

<Note>
  Percolator programs are deployed on both Solana devnet and mainnet. See the [Programs & Deployments](/programs) page for current addresses and verified build details.
