## Repositories

The Percolator protocol consists of four open-source repositories, originally created by Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko and maintained by Purple.trade:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="percolator-prog" icon="github" href="https://github.com/purpletrade/percolator-prog">
    Core Solana smart contract — the perpetual futures engine. Single-file Rust program (~4,400 lines) implementing all 22 instructions, slab state management, and risk checks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="percolator-cli" icon="github" href="https://github.com/purpletrade/percolator-cli">
    Command-line interface for account initialization, deposits, withdrawals, trading, and keeper crank operations. Includes stress-test bots. Apache 2.0 licensed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="percolator-match" icon="github" href="https://github.com/purpletrade/percolator-match">
    Passive LP matcher program. Provides liquidity with a 50bps spread via CPI (cross-program invocation) from the main Percolator program.
  </Card>
  <Card title="percolator" icon="github" href="https://github.com/purpletrade/percolator">
    Formally verified risk engine library. Uses Kani model checking for invariants like conservation (no value created from nothing) and isolation (no cross-account contagion) — ensures no over-withdrawals.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Original Source

These repositories are forked from Anatoly Yakovenko's original implementations:

- [`aeyakovenko/percolator-prog`](https://github.com/aeyakovenko/percolator-prog) — Original program source
- [`aeyakovenko/percolator-cli`](https://github.com/aeyakovenko/percolator-cli) — Original CLI

See the [History](/history) page for the full story of Percolator's origins.

## Devnet Deployment

All Percolator programs are currently deployed on Solana **devnet** for testing.

| Component | Address |
|-----------|---------|
| Percolator Program | `2SSnp35m7FQ7cRLNKGdW5UzjYFF6RBUNq7d3m5mqNByp` |
| Matcher Program | `4HcGCsyjAqnFua5ccuXyt8KRRQzKFbGTJkVChpS7Yfzy` |
| Meteora DBC | `dbcij3LWUppWqq96dh6gJWwBifmcGfLSB5D4DuSMaqN` |

<Note>
  Devnet programs are for testing only. Tokens and positions on devnet have no value.

## Mainnet

<Info>
  Purple.trade is deploying its own Percolator program instance on Solana mainnet. Program addresses will be announced at launch.

## Program Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────┐
│  percolator-prog     │     │   percolator-match    │
│  (perpetual engine)  │────▶│   (LP matcher, 50bps) │
└──────────┬───────────┘     └───────────────────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌──────────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────┐
│    Slab Account      │     │   percolator          │

```

Each perpetual market is a single slab account owned by the Percolator program. The Matcher program handles LP order matching via CPI. The risk engine library provides formally verified invariants that the on-chain program enforces.
