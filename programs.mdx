## Mainnet

New verified program deployments are in progress. Both programs will be deployed with:

- **Upgrade authority** retained for security patching
- **Verified builds** via [Ellipsis-Labs/solana-verifiable-build](https://github.com/Ellipsis-Labs/solana-verifiable-build) Docker containers
- **`security.txt`** embedded in the on-chain binary ([neodyme-labs/solana-security-txt](https://github.com/neodyme-labs/solana-security-txt))
- Green verification badges on Solana explorers

| Program | Address | Verified Build |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Percolator | Deploying | [CI run](https://github.com/purpletrade/percolator-prog/actions/runs/21861779506) |
| Matcher | [`MTCPqs6RWWUPMHhvZnnB6BLAXS86TDpTaxQW7Pa3aDh`](https://explorer.solana.com/address/MTCPqs6RWWUPMHhvZnnB6BLAXS86TDpTaxQW7Pa3aDh) | [CI run](https://github.com/purpletrade/percolator-match/actions/runs/21863187116) |

## Architecture

```

Each perpetual market is a single slab account owned by the Percolator program. The Matcher handles LP order matching via CPI. The risk engine library provides formally verified invariants that the on-chain program enforces.

See the [Repositories](/repo-percolator-prog) section for detailed documentation on each component.
