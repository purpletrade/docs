## Overview

Purple.trade's launch pipeline turns any new token into a tradeable perpetual market. The process uses **Meteora Dynamic Bonding Curves (DBC)** for price discovery, then automatically deploys a Percolator perpetual market when the bonding curve completes.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your token">
    Submit your token details (name, symbol, description, logo) through the Purple.trade launch page. A Meteora DBC pool is created automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bonding curve phase">
    Users buy and sell on the Meteora bonding curve. Price discovery happens naturally — Meteora handles all the mechanics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bond threshold reached">
    When the pool reaches the SOL threshold, Meteora triggers migration. Purple.trade detects this automatically via webhook.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Perpetual market deployed">
    Purple.trade automatically deploys a full Percolator perpetual market for your token — slab creation, oracle setup, LP initialization, and seed liquidity. No manual steps required.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Auto-Deploy Pipeline

When bonding completes, the following happens automatically:

1. **InitMarket** — Creates a new slab account (4096 account slots) and vault
2. **SetOracleAuthority** — Configures the price oracle
3. **PushOraclePrice** — Seeds the initial price from the bonding curve
4. **KeeperCrank** — Activates the risk engine
5. **InitLP** — Creates the vAMM liquidity provider
6. **DepositCollateral** — Seeds initial LP liquidity

The entire deployment takes a few seconds and costs approximately 10 SOL (funded from the migration fee).

## Bonding Curve Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Bond threshold | ~80 SOL |
| Migration fee | ~13% (~10 SOL) |
| LP lock | 100% locked (rug-proof) |
| Token supply | 1,000,000,000 |
| Fee decay | 50% → 2% over 15 minutes |

## After Launch

Once the perpetual market is live:

- The token appears on Purple.trade's market list with a "Live" badge
- Users can trade with up to 10x leverage immediately
- Oracle prices are pushed automatically from market data
- All standard trading features are available (candles, trade history, position tracking)

## Failure Handling

If auto-deploy fails for any reason:

- The launch is marked as `bond_deploy_failed` with an error reason
- Funds remain safe in the treasury
- Admin can retry the deployment or intervene manually
- Users are notified of the status on the launch page

<Note>
  Token launch is currently available on devnet for testing. Mainnet launch is coming soon.
