## What is Purple.trade?

Purple.trade is the first launchpad that turns any token into a perpetual trading market on Solana. Leveraged trading for tokens that centralized exchanges will never list — fully on-chain, no off-chain orderbook, no sequencer, no bridge.

Powered by the **Percolator engine** — an open-source perpetual futures protocol created by Solana co-founder [Anatoly Yakovenko](https://x.com/toly), where entire market state lives in a single on-chain account (a "slab").

## Architecture

```

```

- **Liquidity**: vAMM (virtual automated market maker) — no external LPs required at launch
- **Oracle**: Authority mode for small-cap tokens, Pyth integration for established feeds
- **Data**: Real-time candles, trade detection, and position tracking via Convex backend
