## What is purple.trade?

purple.trade is the first launchpad that turns any token into a perpetual trading market on Solana. Leveraged trading for tokens that centralized exchanges will never list — fully on-chain, no off-chain orderbook, no sequencer, no bridge.

Powered by the **Percolator engine** — an open-source perpetual futures protocol created by Solana co-founder [Anatoly Yakovenko](https://x.com/toly), where entire market state lives in a single on-chain account (a "slab").

## How It Works

- **Fully on-chain** — every trade settles in a single Solana transaction, no off-chain matching
- **One slab = one market** — entire market state (positions, collateral, funding) lives in a single account
- **Token is the collateral** — inverted perpetual model, no stablecoins or synthetics needed
- **Instant liquidity** — vAMM provides liquidity from block one, no external LPs required
- **Real-time data** — candles, trade history, and position tracking updated every 10 seconds
