## The Difference

Open-source perpetual futures protocols are public. Anyone can fork the code, deploy a program, and call it a DEX. But a protocol is not a product — the infrastructure between the blockchain and the trader is what makes a platform.

## Real-Time Infrastructure

purple.trade runs a **serverless Convex backend** that transforms raw Solana state into a live trading experience. This is the single largest infrastructure investment in the platform — and the layer most forks skip entirely.

### The 10-Second Pipeline

Every 10 seconds, for every active market:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Solana RPC\ngetAccountInfo(slab)"] --> B["Binary Parser\nheader + config + 4096 accounts"]
    B --> C["Price Tick\n+ Account Snapshot"]
    C --> D["Trade Detection\nstate diff → open / close / liquidation"]
    D --> E["Candle Aggregation\n1m · 5m · 15m · 1h · 4h · 1d"]
    E --> F["Reactive Publish\nevery connected client updates instantly"]
    style A fill:#1e1b2e,stroke:#6D28D9,color:#F1EEFF
    style B fill:#1e1b2e,stroke:#6D28D9,color:#F1EEFF
    style C fill:#1e1b2e,stroke:#7E3AF2,color:#F1EEFF
    style D fill:#1e1b2e,stroke:#7E3AF2,color:#F1EEFF
    style E fill:#2d1f5e,stroke:#7E3AF2,color:#F1EEFF
    style F fill:#2d1f5e,stroke:#A78BFA,color:#F1EEFF
```

The frontend never polls. Every component — price, chart, position, order book — is a reactive subscriber. When the backend writes, every client receives it instantly.

### Data Architecture

| Layer | Tables | Refresh |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Market State** | markets, priceTicks, marketStats | 10s |
| **Trading Data** | trades, accountSnapshots, candles (6 timeframes) | 10s |
| **Launch Lifecycle** | launches, volumeAccumulator | Event-driven |
| **Discovery** | Market scan + auto-index | 60s |

<Note>
  This is what separates a trading terminal from a block explorer with a trade button. Without it, you're reading stale state.
</Note>

## Scalability

### Slab Isolation

Each perpetual market is a single, independent Solana account. No shared state, no global bottleneck.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Parallel Execution"
        S1["Slab A\nToken X"]
        S2["Slab B\nToken Y"]
        S3["Slab C\nToken Z"]
    end
    S1 ---|"independent"| S2
    S2 ---|"independent"| S3
    V["Solana Validators"] --> S1
    V --> S2
    V --> S3
    style S1 fill:#2d1f5e,stroke:#7E3AF2,color:#F1EEFF
    style S2 fill:#2d1f5e,stroke:#7E3AF2,color:#F1EEFF
    style S3 fill:#2d1f5e,stroke:#7E3AF2,color:#F1EEFF
    style V fill:#1e1b2e,stroke:#6D28D9,color:#F1EEFF
```

| Scale | Backend | Latency |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 10 markets | Baseline | None |
| 100 markets | Linear (serverless) | None — parallel fetches |
| 1,000 markets | Tiered sync, active prioritized | Sub-second for active |

Adding a market means adding an account — not modifying shared state. The Convex backend scales serverlessly. No architectural ceiling.

### Auto-Deploy Pipeline

Any SPL token can have a perpetual market — no curation, no governance vote, no manual listing.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Create Token"] --> B["Bonding Curve\n~80 SOL threshold"]
    B --> C["Bond Detected\nauto-trigger"]
    C --> D["Deploy Perp Market\nslab + vault + oracle + LP"]
    D --> E["Live in Terminal\ncharts + trading + positions"]
    style A fill:#1e1b2e,stroke:#6D28D9,color:#F1EEFF
    style B fill:#1e1b2e,stroke:#6D28D9,color:#F1EEFF
    style C fill:#2d1f5e,stroke:#7E3AF2,color:#F1EEFF
    style D fill:#2d1f5e,stroke:#7E3AF2,color:#F1EEFF
    style E fill:#2d1f5e,stroke:#A78BFA,color:#F1EEFF
```

From token creation to leveraged trading — fully automated, no human intervention.
