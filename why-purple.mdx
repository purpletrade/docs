## The Difference

Open-source perpetual futures protocols are public. Anyone can fork the code, deploy a program, and call it a DEX. But a protocol is not a product.

purple.trade is a production trading platform — a real-time terminal with live data infrastructure, automated market deployment, and verified on-chain programs. This page explains what's running under the hood and why it matters to traders.

---

## Real-Time Data Layer

Most on-chain protocols give you a program and a CLI. purple.trade runs a **serverless backend powered by Convex** that turns raw Solana state into a live trading experience.

### The 10-Second Pipeline

Every 10 seconds, the platform executes a full data cycle for every active market:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fetch">
    Read the raw slab account from Solana RPC — the entire market state in one call.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Parse">
    Decode the binary slab (header, config, engine state, all 4096 account slots) into structured data. No Anchor, no IDL — direct binary parsing for speed and correctness.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Snapshot">
    Store a price tick and a full account snapshot. Every position, every collateral balance, every funding accrual — captured and timestamped.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Detect">
    Diff the current snapshot against the previous one. Any change in position size, collateral, or account state is classified as a trade — open, close, increase, decrease, or liquidation. No indexer dependency. No event parsing. Pure state diffing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Aggregate">
    Upsert OHLCV candles across six timeframes simultaneously: 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d. Roll volume into a 24-hour accumulator with hourly bucketing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish">
    Patch the live market record. Every frontend component subscribed to this market receives the update instantly via reactive subscription — no polling, no websocket management, no stale data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This runs for every market, every 10 seconds, automatically.

### Reactive Subscriptions

The frontend never polls. Every component — price display, position card, chart, order book, stats bar — is a **reactive subscriber** to the Convex backend. When the backend writes new data, every connected client receives it in real time. Open the terminal on two devices and watch them update in lockstep.

### What This Means for Traders

| Capability | What it delivers |
|------------|-----------------|
| 10-second price ticks | Live oracle prices without manual refresh |
| Automatic trade detection | Every open, close, increase, decrease, and liquidation captured |
| Six-timeframe candles | Full OHLCV charting from 1-minute to daily |
| Reactive position sync | Your PnL, margin ratio, and liquidation price update live |
| 24h rolling volume | Accurate volume stats computed from on-chain state diffs |
| Market discovery | New on-chain markets detected and indexed every 60 seconds |

<Note>
  This data layer is what separates a trading terminal from a block explorer with a trade button. Without it, you're reading stale state.
</Note>

## Scalability

### Permissionless Markets

purple.trade does not curate a fixed list of markets. Any SPL token on Solana can have a perpetual futures market — deployed automatically, indexed automatically, tradeable immediately.

The architecture scales horizontally by design:

- **One slab = one market.** Each perpetual market is an independent Solana account. No shared state, no global orderbook bottleneck, no cross-market contagion.
- **Parallel execution.** Because markets are isolated accounts, Solana validators can process trades on different markets in parallel within the same block.
- **Auto-deploy pipeline.** When a token's bonding curve completes, the platform detects it and deploys a full Percolator perpetual market — slab creation, oracle setup, LP initialization, seed liquidity — in seconds. No human intervention.
- **Auto-index.** The backend discovers new on-chain markets every 60 seconds and begins the 10-second data pipeline immediately.

### The Launch Pipeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a token">
    Submit token details through the launch page. A Meteora Dynamic Bonding Curve pool is created automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Price discovery">
    Users buy and sell on the bonding curve. When the pool reaches the SOL threshold (~80 SOL), migration triggers automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Perpetual market deployed">
    The platform detects the bond completion and auto-deploys a full Percolator perpetual market — slab, vault, oracle, LP, seed liquidity. No manual steps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Live trading">
    The market appears in the terminal with live charts, trade history, and position tracking. Traders can open leveraged positions immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This pipeline is what "permissionless" actually means. Not 7 hand-picked markets. Not a governance vote to list a new token. Any token, automatically.

### Growth Model

| Markets | Data pipeline cost | Latency impact |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| 10 | Baseline | None |
| 100 | Linear (Convex scales serverless) | None — parallel slab fetches |
| 1,000 | Tiered sync (active markets prioritized) | Sub-second for active markets |

The slab architecture means adding a new market is adding a new account — not modifying shared state. The Convex backend scales serverlessly. There is no architectural ceiling on market count.

## The Trading Terminal

purple.trade is not a CLI. It is a full trading terminal designed for the same workflows traders use on centralized exchanges.

### Three-Panel Layout

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Order Book" icon="list">
    Positions, LP accounts, leaderboard, and trade history — tabbed and scrollable. Every entry shows direction, leverage, entry price, PnL, and liquidation price.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Charts" icon="chart-candlestick">
    Real-time candlestick charts with 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d timeframes. Live price overlay. Entry and liquidation markers when you have an open position.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Order Entry" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Direction selector, leverage presets (1x–10x), collateral input with percentage buttons. Real-time simulation shows notional value, margin required, trading fee, and margin ratio before you submit.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### What Traders Get

- **Live PnL tracking** — position value, unrealized profit/loss, and return on equity update in real time
- **Margin health visualization** — see your margin ratio and distance to liquidation at a glance
- **Trade simulation** — before submitting, see exactly what your notional, margin, and fee will be at the current oracle price
- **Market browser** — search, sort, and filter all active markets by TVL, open interest, position count, or launch date
- **Mobile responsive** — the terminal adapts to any screen size, stacking panels vertically on mobile
- **Multi-wallet support** — connect via Phantom, Solflare, Ledger, Backpack, or any Solana wallet adapter

## Verified and Hardened

Taking an open-source protocol to production means more than deploying it. purple.trade has verified, audited, and hardened every layer.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="143 Formal Proofs" icon="shield-check">
    The risk engine is verified using Kani model checking — conservation, isolation, and no-over-withdrawal invariants proven mathematically, not just tested.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verified Builds" icon="fingerprint">
    Deterministic Docker builds produce the exact same binary every time. SHA-256 hashes published. Anyone can reproduce and compare against the on-chain program.
  </Card>
  <Card title="OtterSec Verified" icon="badge-check">
    Both mainnet programs pass OtterSec on-chain verification and display green badges on Solscan.
  </Card>
  <Card title="SDK Audit" icon="magnifying-glass">
    The TypeScript SDK is verified byte-for-byte against the Rust source — 21/21 instructions, 25/25 error codes, all PDA derivations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Every change is tracked against Anatoly Yakovenko's original source via automated upstream sync. Security metadata is embedded directly in the on-chain binaries.

## The Convex Backend

The data layer deserves its own section because it is the single largest infrastructure investment in the platform — and the thing most forks skip entirely.

### Eight Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **markets** | Market metadata, live on-chain state, oracle config, program references |
| **priceTicks** | 10-second price snapshots for every market |
| **accountSnapshots** | Full position state for trade detection via diffing |
| **trades** | Detected trades with side, size, price, type, and trader address |
| **candles** | OHLCV data across 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d timeframes |
| **marketStats** | Rolling stats — TVL, open interest, PnL distribution, user count, volume |
| **launches** | Token launch lifecycle from pending through bonding to live |
| **volumeAccumulator** | 24-hour rolling volume with hourly bucket granularity |

### Three Cron Tiers

| Tier | Interval | Job |
|------|----------|-----|
| **1** | 10 seconds | Tick sync — fetch slab, parse, snapshot, detect trades, aggregate candles, patch market |
| **2** | 60 seconds | Market discovery — scan for new on-chain markets, create records, begin sync |
| **3** | Event-driven | Bond detection — monitor Meteora pools, trigger auto-deploy on threshold |

### Why Convex

Convex is a serverless reactive backend. It scales automatically, requires no infrastructure management, and provides real-time subscriptions out of the box. For a trading platform that needs to serve live data to thousands of concurrent users across hundreds of markets, this is the right architecture — not a VPS running a cron job.
